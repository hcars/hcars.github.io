  The townhall of Leuven is the prime example. It is decked out in statues of various saints and important local historical figures. The queen of all saints is, of course, St. Mary, as you will see in her ubiquitous statues around Belgium, and the Leuven townhall recognizes her in typical style. You may also notice a missing statue where King Leopold II once stood. He is not a figure that Belgians are proud of, and they removed public works that glorify him to help deal his actions.
