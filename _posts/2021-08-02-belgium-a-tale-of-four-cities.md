# What is Belgium anyways?

Belgium, a country whose size is easily surpassed by its strangeness. Imagine a country split down the middle from north to south into two culturally and linguistically distinct regions, and you will get Belgium. Flanders is the west half. It speaks Flemish ( a dialect of Dutch ) and contains Flemish people. Flanders is more urban and wealthy. The Wallonie or Wallonia is the eastern half, and its inhabitants speak French. Wallonia is more rural and doesn't fare as well economically. 

The country was created in the 1800s by the great powers of Europe who saw assisting nascent Belgium's discontent nationalists as a nice way to weaken the Netherlands and maintain the balance of power. Belgium has since gone onto to great things. Among these are waffles, fries, the invention of the saxophone, getting invaded by Germany, sectional divisions, having the EU capital, and being renowned for shitty roads. That's no small order for a country 1/3 the size of my home state, Virginia.


## What is there to see there?

I only saw four cities, but I really saw a lot of them. All of them are in Flanders, so if you are from Wallonia, please don't think I am a crypto-Flemish nationalist. I simply didn't have the chance to see your wonderful region. Now that I have issued the mandatory disclaimer about my blatant Flemo-centrism, I can tell you what I saw and if I think it is worth seeing. My trip centered on the cities of Leuven ( Louvain ), Brussels, Antwerp, and Bruges, so I'll cover them here. 

Besides rustic cities, you will also see a lot of clouds and, with those clouds, rain, so be sure to bring a rain coat or umbrella and don't worry about sun-block.


### Leuven



Leuven hosts Belgium's most well-known university KU Leuven, known in my own field for the Louvain method, and a lot of the city is centered on it. When you arrive in Leuven by train, you will be on the edge of the city proper on the ring road. If you are coming by car, I wouldn't recommend entering the city by car as it uses a complicated system of traffic zones in an attempt to lower thru-traffic. 

From the edge of the city, you can follow several streets into the city center. As in all the cities that I mention, the city center has wonderful architecture. You will find many buildings epitomizing Baroque and Gothic style. Notable buildings are the townhall, the adjacent Saint Peter's Church, KU Leuven's lbirary, the Park Abbey, and Saint Anthony's Church which contains Saint Damien's crypt.

Overall, the vibe is much less touristy than the other cities that I visited, but the town is still quite lively. Leuven's city center has a square whose perimeter is almost entirely covered by bars, earning it the moniker the world's longest bar. Most of them cater to the many students. Said students keep the streets alive, and although Flemish is the native language of Leuven, students have made English the most common language heard on the streets. Belgians like the city a lot, and it has become Belgium's most expensive city. My recommendation is that you visit Leuven and see some of the sights that I detail in a later post although I wouldn't put it on the top of my list. 

### Brussels

Brussels has a wonderful series of Gothic buildings and old churches. As the capital of Belgium and the EU, it is vibrant and bustling. If you enjoy art, particularly the Old Masters, the royal musuem is here and should be on your itenary. If life is feeling a bit surreal to you, you'll find their exhibition of Magritte's work worth a visit. Like much of Belgium, the square surrounding the wonderful Gothic/neo-Gothic cityhall made me, as an American, feel like I was in the Middle Ages. There are some famous statues just outside the cityhall. Down the street is the famous and famously underwhelming, Manneken Pis. Not far away is the Gusiness World Records Title-holder for the most beers on tap, the Delirium Cafe, along with the tourist-trap female Mannekn Pis. If you do visit for a drink or two, or three, be sure to try one of their own Delirium beers. 

Now, it's time for practicalities. Although the city is located inside Flanders, a majority of the city has French as a first language, and communication may be a bit more difficult than in the Flemish speaking-areas. If you take a train to the Brussels Midi, you will find yourself near the center of the city and the main tourist attractions. This is also a good place to find an up to date city guide. 


### Bruges

This city really takes you back in time. Built atop a swamp, a large network of canals flows through Bruges. Though its canals are now occupied solely by tourist boats, one can imagine it was once brimming with boats ferrying goods through this 13th-15th center of Hansaetic trade. By preserving this historic character, Bruges captures crowds of tourists. The city is overshadowed by a huge belfry that lies in the Grote Markt, the city's main square. The city has many Flemish primitives housed its churches, St. John's Hospital, and the Groeninge Museum. All of this combined makes Bruges a wonderful city for historical and art tourists.

When arriving by train, you will be dropped off just outside the edge of the historic part of the city. From there, it is just a short walk to the city proper. The primary native language here is Flemish, and the large volume of tourists makes communication in English very easy.

### Antwerp

Much like Brussels and Leuven, Antwerp is a very cosmopolitan city. Its huge port makes it quite important to Belgium. A lot of the world's diamond trade flows through here. The city's 17th century prominence is visible in its many Baroque buildings including a Baroque church and shopping mall, which feels particulary anachronistic. Antwerp is also home to a large Gothic cathedral that holds three famous art pieces of Peter Paul Rubens: The Raising of the Cross, Assumption of the Virgin Mary, and The Descent From Cross. Aside from historic buildings, you will find numerous cafes to relax with a beer and coffee throughout the city.

When arriving by rail to the central station, you will pass through the impressive 19th-century station. It has by far the most impressive architecture that I have seen in a European train station outside of Berlin's central station. From the central station, it is a fairly short walk to the city's primary attractions.
