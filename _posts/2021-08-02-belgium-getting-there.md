# Getting to Belgium ( From Germany )

## My Experience

I arrived in Belgium on a Deustche Bahn train. My train made the trip only 3 hours later than expected, but I should have expected expectations to be wrong given the floods in the Rheinland-Westphalia and Belgium's Wallonie this year. My fellow passengers, commiserating the train's lateness, testified to the region's international nature. On the train, I heard various languages ranging from German, English, Spanish, French and Russian, and only Dutch, French, and German are official languages there. As we passed through the fields and small towns of the Wallonie, I spoke to a Spaniard ( who lives in Germany), a Spaniard ( who lives in Spain), a Wallon, and a girl that I was suppose was Flemish. Yes, Belgium and Brussels, in particular, really is the multicultural center that one would expect of the EU capital. 

When I finally arrived in Brussels to change trains for Antwerp, I stepped out of the modern, clean Deustche Bahn train and into the dingy station of Bruxelles-Nord. There, I waited for my train with a German girl also traveling to Antwerp. When our train finally did arrive, it was a step back into the '70s. There yellow-faded curtains on the windows and graffiti abounded. The German girl looked at me bewildered and commented about the ricketiness of the train. I wasn't sure what the central stop would look like, so I asked a man sitting by the door. Neither of us sharing a common tongue, we communicated in a mix of English and German. He told me when we arrived in Antwerp, and, there, I was meeting up with the friends that I was staying with. The bumpy start introduced me to the feeling of disjointed created by the seemingly random amalgation of languages and cultures.


## Ok, Enough Storytelling, How Do I get there?

### By Train From Germany

Logistically, I recommend an Interrail (Eurail if you are an EU resident) pass to get from Germany to Belgium. These passes allow you to pay a flat rate to use unlimited trains on a certain number of days over a month. When I purchased one, I the minimum number of days was a 4-day pass, and it was roughly $200. You can add more for lower unit price if you will be traveling more in the same month. If you don't want to use one of these passes, you can buy a ticket with Deutsche Bahn to Brussels and buy a separate ticket from Brussels to get to your destination. Unlike with Deutsche Bahn, you can pay for a train between two specific destinations and take any train that you would like.

### By Flight From Germany

Don't take a flight when it is perfectly reasonable to take a train. If you feel compelled to travel by plane, pay for a carbon offset.
